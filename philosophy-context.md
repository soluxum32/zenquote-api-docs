# ZenQuote API – Philosophical Context

Zen koans are not intellectual puzzles; they are encounters with reality. Each quote returned by this API is a chance to stop the mind’s search for answers and instead experience the texture of direct perception.

### Why a Koan API?

In an age of algorithmic answers and relentless certainty, the koan reminds us of the value of *not-knowing*—of standing before the unknown without resistance.

This project bridges technical communication with meditative awareness. The interface may be digital, but the experience it invites is timeless.
